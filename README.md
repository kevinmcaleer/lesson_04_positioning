# Lesson 4 - Positioning
This is the code I use in the <https://www.smarsfan.com/play/lessons/lesson_04_positioning> Tutorial; there is a companion video for this too: <https://youtu.be/oZ1Ikr_WElI>

> NOTICE!
> This code doesn't currently complile, but I'm sure you can find the simple mistake in the loop.ino file (the variable `turn_heading` needs to be declared).

Happy for you to correct this and send a pull request via GitHub.
